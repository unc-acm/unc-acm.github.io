 id="x1-1000"></a>Strongly Connected Components</h3>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-12">Def. </span>We say that vertices <span 
class="cmmi-12">u </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-12">v </span>are in the same strongly connected component of a graph if
there exists a path from <span 
class="cmmi-12">u </span>to <span 
class="cmmi-12">v </span>and from <span 
class="cmmi-12">v </span>to <span 
class="cmmi-12">u</span>.
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Notice that in an undirected graph, connectedness implies strongly connectedness, as every edge is
bidirectional. Therefore we are going to only consider directed graphs.
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Finding the strongly connected components of a graph allows us to partition the graph into
strongly connected subgraphs within which one can get from each vertex to every other
vertex.
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Kosaraju&#8217;s algorithm</h4>
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >Kosaraju&#8217;s algorithm is what we can use to find the strongly connected components of the graph in
<span 
class="cmmi-12">O</span>(<span 
class="cmmi-12">E </span>+ <span 
class="cmmi-12">V </span>) time. The algorithm relies on the fact that the strongly connected components of the
graph are the same as the strongly connected components of the transpose graph (same graph with
the direction of all the edges reversed).
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >Kosaraju&#8217;s algorithm is essentially two DFS, one on the graph and another on the reverse graph.
The first DFS on the original graph is a reverse topological sort(ish), we sort the list of vertices in
such a way that <span 
class="cmmi-12">u </span>comes before <span 
class="cmmi-12">v </span>if there exists and edge from <span 
class="cmmi-12">v </span>to <span 
class="cmmi-12">u</span>. I say this is
approximately a topological sort because technically one cannot topologically sort a graph if it
contains a cycle, but in our case, if it contains a cycle, we ignore it, and keep going.
Note that this will sometimes create forests in connected graphs as a result, but that&#8217;s
fine.
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Now we have this list, note that the first element of the list is a node in the original graph that is
either in a cycle or has no incoming edges. Now we dfs from this node on the <span 
class="cmbx-12">transpose </span>graph,
and every element it can get to is guaranteed to be in the same strongly connected component as
it, this is because the SCC of the transpose graph is the same as that of the original
graph. After we dfs from that point, we move onto the next un-assigned element in the
sorted list and repeat the process, thereby generating a group of strongly connected
subgraphs.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Boolean Satisfiability Problems</h4>
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >There is a special type of problems called boolean satisfiability problems that can be solved
with Kosaraju&#8217;s algorithm. The problem is relatively simple, given a bunch of boolean
variables <span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-12">,x</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-12">,</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">&hellip;</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">,x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">n</span></sub> and a boolean expression expressed as the conjunction of several
pairwise disjunctions using these variables. Our task is to determine if there exists a
solution.
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >To solve this problem we introduce something called the <span 
class="cmbx-12">implication graph</span>. The implication
graph is a graph where there exists an edge between two nodes if there exists a logical
implication that if one node is true so is the next. We construct the implication graph as
follows: if the entire boolean expression is true, then each of the pairwise disjunctions
are true (because they are all connected via conjunctions). Therefore suppose we have
(<span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&or; </span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">j</span></sub>) as a part of the conjunction, then we can construct two edges: <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¬</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&rarr; </span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">j</span></sub> and
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¬</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">j</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">&rarr; </span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub>.
<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >Once we construct the implication graph, we know that the equation is <span 
class="cmbx-12">NOT </span>satisfiable if <span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub> and
<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¬</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub> are within the strongly connected component. As that would mean <span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub> and <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-120">¬</span><span 
class="cmmi-12">x</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">i</span></sub> must both be
true.
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >Otherwise we can pick an arbitrary starting point, assign it <span 
class="cmtt-12">true</span>, its opposite <span 
class="cmtt-12">false </span>and floodfill
those truth values to its strongly connected component.
